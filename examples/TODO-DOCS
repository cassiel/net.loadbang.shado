Explain that "no such function: bang" etc. is not a problem: different
scripts have different functions provided depending on needs.

Make sure we don't get Null Pointer Exception if no script comment.

Tutorials in sections: a goal for each set of tutorials.

Need to reload script list each time a new file is created.

library - an alias? - not actually creating or running any code.
Telling a script where to find the code.

shado is a philosophical statement - to make declarative the structure
of an interface. Things that Max is not good for - moving these kinds
of structure out of Max and into a simple scripting language - teach
how to think about programming - how to think about building things in
a more considered kind of way.

Annotated longer examples - a "fast track".

Bring in button response at the shado level quite early - present as
boilerplate.

Make the conceptual model clear - overt - isometric images.

Clarify: input handler blocks - transparent.
